          >
          takes place several months after the events of the previous game,
          Ocarina of Time. Link, now the Hero of Time, searches for his fairy
          companion, Navi, who left Hyrule after peace was restored to the land.
          While searching the Lost Woods on his horse, Epona, Link is ambushed
          by a Skull Kid wearing a sinister looking mask and two fairies, Tatl
          and Tael. Skull Kid steals the Ocarina of Time from Link and takes off
          on Epona. Link chases after Skull Kid on foot but falls into a trap.
          After coming to, Link is met by Skull Kid who curses him, turning him
          into a Deku Scrub. Skull Kid then flees but accidently leaves Tatl
          behind. Tatl reluctantly reveals to Link that she and Tael are brother
          and sister and that Tael will be lost without his sister by his side.
          They put their differences aside and together they follow Skull Kid to
          Clock Town, a village in the center of an alternate land to Hyrule
          known as Termina.
        </p>
        <p>
          They meet the Happy Mask Salesman who asks Link to retrieve the mask
          that was stolen from him by Skull Kid. In exchange, the Happy Mask
          Salesman promises to turn Link back into a Hylian. He also states that
          he must leave Clock Town in three days so Link must retrieve the mask
          before then. Link agrees and he and Tatl go off to search for Skull
          Kid. During their search they discover that Skull Kid has caused a lot
          of mischief in Clock Town and has even put a curse on the moon,
          causing it to slowly be pulled on a collision course with Termina.
          They finally track down Skull Kid on the night of the third day and
          confront him on top of the Clock Town tower. Tael tells Link and Tatl
          that they must awaken the Four Giants, Termina's guardians, so that
          they can stop the moon from destroying Termina. After recovering his
          stolen Ocarina, Link plays the Song of Time which transports him a
          Tatl back three days, back to when they first arrived in Termina.
        </p>
        <p>
          Link speaks again with the Happy Mask Salesman who turns Link back
          into a Hylian using the recovered Ocarina of Time. Once the curse is
          lifted, the Happy Mask Salesman asks Link to give him the stolen mask
          he was supposed to recover from Skull Kid. However, Link never
          recovered the mask and upon realizing this, the Happy Mask Salesman
          becomes furious. He tells Link that the mask Skull Kid stole is known
          as Majora's Mask and that it contains a terrible evil that could be
          devasting if it fell into the wrong hands. Once the Happy Mask
          Salesman regains his composure, he sends Link and Tatl off to properly
          recover Majora's Mask.

            class="rightimage"
            alt="Map of the regions of Termina"
          />Link and Tatl journey to the four regions of Termina to awaken the
          Four Giants:
          <span>Woodfall, Snowhead, Great Bay, and Ikana Canyon.</span> During
          their travels they learn that Majora's Mask has been wreaking havoc
          across all four regions of Termina. The waters of Woodfall have been
          poisoned and the Deku princess of the Deku Palace has been kidnapped.
          Snowhead has been afflicted by an endless winter which is causing the
          Goron race to starve. The water in Great Bay has been contaminated
          causing the sea creatures to turn into monsters and in Ikana Canyon,
          the people living in the region have been plagued by a curse that
          brings the dead back to life. Link also learns that Skull Kid and the
          Four Giants were at one time close friends but when the giants became
          the guardians of Termina, they had to leave Skull Kid. Tatl and Tael
          then befriended the lonely Skull Kid and accompanied him in his
          mischief making which ultimately led to him stealing Majora's Mask
          from the Happy Mask Salesman. Feeling abandoned by the Four Giants,
          Skull Kid then put a curse on Termina using the evil powers of the
          mask.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once Link and Tatl restore peace to all four regions and awaken the
          Four Giants, they confront Skull Kid on top of the Clock Town tower.
          After summoning the Four Giants to keep the moon from destroying
          Termina, Majora's Mask comes to life and takes control of the moon,
          leaving Skull Kid behind. Link has a final battle with Majora's Mask
          inside the moon and defeats the evil mask. Having finally retrieved
          his stolen mask, the Happy Mask Salesman states that all the evil has
          left Majora's Mask and departs from Termina with the mask in hand. The
          Four Giants and Tatl and Tael forgive Skull Kid as it was clear that
          he was being possessed by Majora's Mask. Skull Kid then befriends Link
          and in the final scene of the game we are shown a tree stump in the
          lost woods where Skull Kid has drawn a picture of himself, his new
          friend Link, Tatl and Tael, and the Four Giants.
