          Even though Majora's Mask was the second instalment in the 3D Legend
          of Zelda game catalogue, the development process was vastly different
          from its predecessor, Ocarina of Time. The development team was led by
          Eiji Aonuma, Yoshiaki Koizumi, and Shigeru Miyamoto. Both Miyamoto and
          Aonuma worked on Ocarina of Time. While Ocarina of Time took 5 years
          to develop, Miyamoto challenged the team working on Majora's Mask to
          complete the game within a year. The game engine and many of the
          assets were reused from Ocarina of Time which allowed the team to
          develop the entire game within 15 months.

        <h2>Technical Differences from Ocarina of Time</h2>

          The game was initially planned to be a remixed edition of Ocarina of
          Time released for the Nintendo 64DD (Disk Drive) peripheral. However,
          due to the commercial failure of the 64DD in Japan, the 64DD never got
          an international release. Majora's Mask was released for the N64 but
          because it used an upgraded version of the Ocarina of Time engine, it
          required the Nintendo 64's 4MB Expansion Pak to be playable. The
          expansion pack allowed for greater draw distance which eliminated the
          need for the fog effect and cardboard panorama which were used in
          Ocarina of Time to obscure distant areas. It also allowed for more
          characters to be on screen at once.
