            >Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</a
          >, a remake for the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, development began
          on a remake of Majora's Mask. The development team consisted of The
          Legend of Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma and co-developers Grezzo,
          a Japanese video game development company who also worked on Ocarina
          of Time 3D. The project was kept under wraps during development. Both
          Aonuma and the team at Grezzo came up with a list of moments in the
          original N64 version that seemed unreasonable for players that they
          called the “what in the world” list. The team adjusted each item on
          the list in the remake and as a result, Aonuma felt that the 3DS
          remake feels more forgiving than original version.

          Like it's predecessor, Ocarina of Time 3D, Majors Mask 3D is an
          enhanced remake that features stereoscopic 3D graphics, more detailed
          environmental textures, a higher framerate of 30 frames-per-second, a
          new touchscreen user interface, and gyroscopic aiming.

          There were several features of the game that were updated for the 3DS
          remake. One of the upgraded features was the Song of Double Time. In
          the original N64 version, the Song of Double Time allowed the player
          to travel forward in time but only in 6 hour intervals. In Majora's
          Mask 3D, the player can travel forward to any hour of the given day.
          The Bomber's Notebook was an inventory item that players could use to
          log information about select non-playable characters (NPCs). It was
          enhanced in the remake to include detailed information about all of
          the NPCs.
