        <h1>Music</h1>
        <p>
          The music for The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask was written by Koji
          Kondo with contributions from Toru Minegishi. Koji Kondo is best known
          for his many musical contributions to Nintendo's Super Mario and The
          Legend of Zelda series. Kondo has said that the music of Majora's Mask
          resembles that of a Chinese opera. The soundtrack consists of reworked
          tracks from Ocarina of Time, some familiar music from previous The
          Legend of Zelda games, and new material.

        <h2>Music as Part of Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
          Like Ocarina of Time, music is part of the gameplay in Majora's Mask.
          By playing certain songs on his Ocarina Link is able do things like
          travel through time, alter the passing of time, and heal those that
          have been affected by Majora's curse. Using special masks, Link is
          also able to transform into three of the different species that
          inhabit Termina: a Deku Scrub, a Goran, and a Zora. When Link
          transforms into one of the different species, his Ocarina transforms
          into a different musical instrument. In Deku form, Link's Ocarina
          becomes a set of brass pipes known as Deku pipes. In Goran form, his
          Ocarina becomes a set of drums and when Link transforms into a Zora,
          his Ocarina turns into a fish bone guitar. To complete certain parts
          of the game, Link must transform and play a particular song on one of
          the three different instruments.
